        <p>On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are
            found underwater. For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by
            divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic
            plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the
            East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande rift in North America.
            Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the
            coreâ€“mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) deep in the Earth. This results in hotspot volcanism, of
            which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example. Volcanoes a</p>
        <p>he word volcano is derived from the name of Vulcano, a volcanic island in the Aeolian Islands of Italy whose
            name in turn comes from Vulcan, the god of fire in Roman mythology.[3] The study of volcanoes is called
            volcanology, sometimes spelled vulcanology.[4]</p>
